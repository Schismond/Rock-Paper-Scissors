# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is Rock-Paper-Scissors game built as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. The website is built using only JS.

## Features

The goal of the lesson "Foundations: Rock Paper Scissors" from The Odin Project is to introduce and guide learners through the process of building a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using JavaScript. The lesson aims to teach fundamental concepts of programming and problem-solving while providing hands-on experience in developing a functional game.

Throughout the lesson, learners are expected to gain an understanding of the following key concepts:

Basic JavaScript syntax and programming principles.
Variables, data types, and operators.
Conditional statements (if/else) for decision-making.
User input and interaction using the browser's console.
Functions and their role in organizing code.
Random number generation for computer-generated moves.
Looping and iterating to create a playable game.
By completing the lesson, learners should have a working understanding of how to create interactive programs using JavaScript and gain confidence in their ability to build simple games from scratch.
